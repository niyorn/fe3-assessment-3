## Proces

The first thing I did was download the source file of the sanky plugin. From this source it will create this sanky.
![sanky example](assets/image/sanky-example.PNG)

To get the the graph working we need to format our dataset to a dataset that looks like this:
```
{
"nodes":[
{"name":"Barry"},
{"name":"Frodo"},
{"name":"Elvis"},
{"name":"Sarah"},
{"name":"Alice"}
],

"links":[
{"source":"Barry","target":"Sarah","value":2},
{"source":"Barry","target":"Alice","value":2},
{"source":"Frodo","target":"Sarah","value":4},
{"source":"Elvis","target":"Alice","value":2},
{"source":"Elvis","target":"Sarah","value":2}
]}
```
The 'nodes' are the blocks.
And the links cooordinate which nodes needs to connect with each other.

### Format the data
First of all I created an array that saved all the music genre that there is in the dataset;
From there I created a function that search for all the people that like specific genre.
The function looks like this:
```javascript
//All the music genre that are in the dataset
var allMusicGenre = ['Dance', 'Folk', 'Country', 'Classical music', 'Musical', 'Pop', 'Rock', 'Metal or Hardrock', 'Punk', 'Hiphop, Rap', 'Reggae, Ska', 'Swing,  Jazz', "Rock 'n Roll", 'Alternative', 'Latino', 'Techno, Trance', 'Opera'];

var nestData = [];

allMusicGenre.forEach(function(musicGenre) {
  let music = {};
  let total = 0;
  let like = 3;
  let allPosition = [];
  var value =[];

  data.forEach(function(d, position) {
    if (d[musicGenre] > like) {
      allPosition.push(position);
      total++;
    };
  });

  music.value = value;
  music.musicGenre = musicGenre;
  music.total = total;
  nestData.push(music)
});
```
This function will give this result:
```
0: {value: Array(11), musicGenre: "Dance", total: 376}
1: {value: Array(11), musicGenre: "Folk", total: 144}
2:{value: Array(11), musicGenre: "Country", total: 118}
3 etc
```

From there we want to know how many of these people like a specific genre.
This function will do just that:
```javascript
allMovieGenre.forEach(function(movieGenre){
  let movieValue = {};
  let movieTotal = 0;
  allPosition.forEach(function(position){
      if(data[position][movieGenre] > like){
        movieTotal++;
      }
  });
  movieValue.movieGenre = movieGenre;
  movieValue.total = movieTotal;
  value.push(movieValue);
});
```
And from that we got this as result;
```
musicGenre:"Dance"
total:376
value: Array(11)
0:{movieGenre: "Horror", total: 139}
1:{movieGenre: "Thriller", total: 203}
2:{movieGenre: "Comedy", total: 343}
3:{movieGenre: "Romantic", total: 214}
4:{movieGenre: "Sci-fi", total: 149}
5 etc
```
Ok now that we have that, lets look at sankey function again and look how it want its data presented. src: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14629853/json-representation-for-d3-force-directed-networks.
```javascript
sankey
  .nodes(sankeyData.nodes)
  .links(sankeyData.links)
  .layout(32);
```
If we look at that function, we can see it wants a 'source', a 'target' and a 'value'.
In our nestData we all have this information. We will create a function that get all the 'source' and value;
The function looks like this:
```javascript
//Format data to sankey
var nodes = [];
var links = [];
var sankyData = {nodes, links};

nestData.forEach(function(d){
  var total = d.movieTotal;
  d.value.forEach(function(data){
    let linkObject = {};
    linkObject.source = d.musicGenre;
    linkObject.target = data.movieGenre;
    linkObject.value = Math.round(data.total/d.movieTotal*100);//calculate the percentage
    links.push(linkObject)
  });
});
```

that will give us this:
```
1:{source: "Dance", target: "Thriller", value: 9}
2:{source: "Dance", target: "Comedy", value: 16}
3:{source: "Dance", target: "Romantic", value: 10}
4:{source: "Dance", target: "Sci-fi", value: 7}
5:{source: "Dance", target: "War", value: 7}
6:{source: "Dance", target: "Fantasy/Fairy tales", value: 11}
7:{source: "Dance", target: "Animated", value: 11}
8:{source: "Dance", target: "Documentary", value: 10}
9:{source: "Dance", target: "Western", value: 2}
10:{source: "Dance", target: "Action", value: 11}
etc
```
/Value is in percentage/

Getting all the name (object) is simple because we already have an array that  saved all  name of the music genre and movie genre;
```javascript
var nodes = [];
//Get all nodes
  allMusicGenre.forEach(function(d){
    nodes.push(d);
  });
  allMovieGenre.forEach(function(d){
    nodes.push(d);
  });
```
From there we saved all data data that we have in an objects
```javascript
var sankyData = {nodes, links};
```
This object contains all the 'nodes', 'source', 'target' and 'value';

Ok now we will add the 'sankeyData' object to the sankey function like this:

```javascript
sankey
  .nodes(sankeyData.nodes)
  .links(sankeyData.links)
  .layout(32);
```

If we refresh the browser, the browser will give this error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'push' of undefined
```
Why is that?

After searching on the web why it doesnt work, I stumble on the solution:
First of all why I doesn't work:

If we look at the sankey function, it is searching for the index, a number value. Like this:

```
{
"nodes":[
{"node":0,"name":"node0"},
{"node":1,"name":"node1"},
{"node":2,"name":"node2"},
{"node":3,"name":"node3"},
{"node":4,"name":"node4"}
],
"links":[
{"source":0,"target":2,"value":2},
{"source":1,"target":2,"value":2},
{"source":1,"target":3,"value":2},
{"source":0,"target":4,"value":2},
{"source":2,"target":3,"value":2},
{"source":2,"target":4,"value":2},
{"source":3,"target":4,"value":4}
]}
```
Here you can see that the source and target correspont with the index of the nodes.  Instead what we have on those places are the name.
So we need to change the name to the index of the nodes.

This little piece of code will do just that for us:
```javascript
var nodeMap = {};
 sankeyData.nodes.forEach(function(x) { nodeMap[x.name] = x; });
 sankeyData.links = sankeyData.links.map(function(x) {
 return {
 source: nodeMap[x.source],
 target: nodeMap[x.target],
 value: x.value
 };
 });
```
this solution comes from stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14629853/json-representation-for-d3-force-directed-networks

Ok now we will refresh the browser again
It will represent us with this:
![sanky example](assets/image/sanky1.PNG)
That more like it!

Still why are nodes without lines?
If we look at the console it give us this error:
```
Error: <path> attribute d: Expected number, "â€¦58505670447 490,NaN 944,NaN".
``
So it gets something that is not a number.

If we nog the 'nestData' we can why that is.
```
11:{value: Array(11), musicGenre: "Swing,  Jazz", total: 0, movieTotal: 0}
12:{value: Array(11), musicGenre: "Rock 'n Roll", total: 0, movieTotal: 0}
```
some value are zero. So we need to create a function that fillter this out.
